    <h1>Veterans Housing</h1>

    <p>
        Permanent housing rooted in dignity, stability, and long-term reintegration.
        This initiative focuses on infrastructure that restores independence — not
        temporary shelter, but sustainable foundations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Development details, phased build strategy, and operational framework will
        be expanded here.
